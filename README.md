<p>wow a todo-list. Original, I know.</p>

<p>I'll say, JavaScript was WAY more complicated then I anticipated, mainly because I got used to HTML and CSS alot lol. It took me about 3 months for me to understand what I'm doing. Like, I could grasp the concept, but putting it in execution was tough. I'm still not fully comfortable using it, so I'll do another project before moving to React. Prob a Weather site.</p>
