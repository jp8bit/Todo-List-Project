<p>wow a todo-list. Original, I know.</p>

<p>I'll say, JavaScript was WAY more complicated then I anticipated, mainly because I got used to HTML and CSS alot lol. It took me about 3 months for me to understand what I'm doing. Like, I could grasp the concept, but putting it in execution was tough. I'm still not fully comfortable using it, so I'll do another project before moving to React. Prob a Weather site.</p>

<p>About the project itself, it is basically a todo list with tagging and pompurin theme. I wish i could have added drag and drop to organize, but that i currently dont know, will prob learn later. There are definitely parts i could have polished more (looking at you editing section), but i want to get into another project as this one took longer than expected. About 1 month, Some days i would work on it, others i would study js. Anyway, hope you like it!!!</p>
